# Treatlive_Healthcare_Database
As the lead developer of 'TreatLive,' I integrated 50+ U.S. healthcare entities, enhancing access for 10,000+ users. By engineering a hybrid MySQL/MongoDB database, I boosted processing efficiency by 30% and scalability via Python analysis. Strategic data modeling using EER/UML improved system design, increasing operational efficiency by 20%
As the driving force behind the development of 'TreatLive,' I orchestrated the seamless integration of 50+ U.S. healthcare entities, revolutionizing accessibility for over 10,000 users via a centralized telemedicine platform. To enhance data processing efficiency, I engineered a hybrid database employing MySQL and MongoDB, resulting in a notable 30% increase in processing efficiency for handling high-volume transactions. Leveraging Python for data analysis, I systematically improved the system's scalability.
In terms of system design, I implemented data modeling using Entity-Relationship Diagrams (EER) and Unified Modeling Language (UML). This strategic approach optimized the overall system design, leading to a remarkable 20% increase in operational efficiency. This enhancement significantly improved data management across multiple healthcare modules, ensuring a more streamlined and effective operation of the entire 'TreatLive' platform
